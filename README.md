# Memory exercise

Recreate the tile-matching game Memory.  Demo:

http://www.zefrank.com/memory/

## V1

* In-class pair programming
* Use any libraries you like
* *Start small*, e.g.
    * 2x2 grid
    * Hard-code as a `<table>`
    * Use letters, numbers or colors as the "values"

## V2

* Finish independently
* If you were using the other person's repository, **make a fork from theirs** and then submit a pull request back to the original repository using this URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/countdown/compare/advanced-js:gh-pages...gh-pages`

## V3

* Refactor to use OOP (Views, maybe Models, etc).

## Bonus points

* "Reset" button
* Randomized board
* Configurable board size
* Score keeping (you can decide what this means)
* Automated tests
* Fancy interactivity/animations
